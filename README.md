**THINGS TO DO AFTER CLONING REPO AND BEYOND:**

1. Make sure to do **pip install -r requirements.txt** right after you clone to get necessary packages (might need to set up an environment first)

2. Before pushing any new changes, always run **"black scripts"** and **"flake8 scripts"** to run linters

3. When commiting, make sure to commit in the format of "type: ...", so like "fix: solved bug in feature space"
